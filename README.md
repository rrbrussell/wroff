# Web Roff

An update of Roff for creating websites, epub, and printable output.

## Why?

Mostly because making easily printable and web nice content with the existing
Roff macro packages is not easy.

## Hugo like interface.

I will probably add a Hugo like tool around this tool.

## Licensing

The Rust code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 only.
The include macros are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
